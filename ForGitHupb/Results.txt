1)The first test is to test if MOSS and SIM by uploading the same files, it is able to detecte plagiary at the same level(percentage)
Results
The SIM tool did recognize the plagiarism and it provided 100% of plagiarism
The MOSS tool did recognize the plagiarism but it provided only 96% of plagiarism.
2) The second test is to change a bit the logic of the method to see if both of them can detecte the plagiarism
Results
The sim didn't not recognize the plagia it assumed that they was no similarities. The percentage is 70%
The Moss as well didn't not recognize the plagia, it assumed that they was no si,ilarities. The percentage is 76%
3) The third test is to check if does recognize the plagiary in case of changing the vairables name
Results
The SIM tool did recognize the plagiarism and it provided 100% of plagiarism.
The MOSS tool did recognize the plagiarism but it provided only 96% of plagiarism

4) The fourth test is to enable the recursive check (Meaning to let for example A to be check against B and B to be checked against A) this is only for SIM
results
the results are 'intersting' because the results obtained are different which shouldn't be the case. the first A vs B gave me 72% and B vs A provided 67%
5) the fifth is to augment the size of the method by adding more statements and changing the variables names 
 Results 
SIM:
SIM provided 79% even if the tool didn't not provide a 100% of plagiary but it did recognize the part changed in the code as smilar to each other. 
MOSS provideed 64% of plagiary but it did recognize the that the logic was changed and it recognized as well the staments.
6) Clone Detection
The test was made to the same files but in the same solution. 
Results
The results shown that they was no macthing between the 2 classes.
